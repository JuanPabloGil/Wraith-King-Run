Wraith King Run is a platform game inspired by those hard-to-play games, but once you get familiar with the controls it's a lot of fun. The game was developed with [Phaser 3](https://www.mapeditor.org/) a framework that allows us to create a game from scratch, assigned physics such as gravity, speed, animations, sounds, and custom maps, for this project I used a tool called [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) which allows us to create [compatible maps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/Tilemaps) which allows us to create compatible maps with Phaser, as it opens the door for people with or without technical knowledge to create their levels and play them!


## Goal of the game.

The main objective of the game is to complete the current level, you can complete the level by going through the goal (green box). If you touch a red square, the game will end.
